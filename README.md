# Missing data analysis 
the main aim of the project was to determine the average magnitude of change depending on groups exposed and unexposed to the factor taking into consideration missing data.
main.R contains the code used on the full data. Example of the data can be seen in example.csv

To achieve this goal, the following steps were taken:
1. EDA- Exploratory data analysis
2. Data imputation under MCAR (missing completely at random), MAR (missing at random) and MNAR (missing not at random)
3. Analysis of the data imputation results
